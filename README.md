# Tour Guide
This is a sample Readme file for our Tourist guide project.

## Description
Videocalls to answer about travel questions, made by locals. If I want to go and visit spain I can pay a time token (i.e. 19$ for 1 hour) and chat with an spanian asking questions about Barcelona, Madrid, daily habits, etc...

### PROs
###### *MVP can start on Google Hangout with low tech involved
###### *You can connect with locals before your trip
###### *Makes people earn money thanks to their knowledge
###### *Can be used for more than travel tips: language lessons, etc...
###### *Can work live, but also "offline": I ask for a question and I receive a video answer later

### CONs
###### *Verification of locals identity and knowledge
###### *Good insurance is needed. What if a tourist is tricked by a local to make something dangerous or at worse into a robbery?
###### *Hard to scale
###### *Once not an MVP anymore you need some tech for video conferencing
###### *A money back guarantee should be offered
